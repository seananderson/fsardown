# fsardown

Experiments with generating reproducible FSARs (Fisheries Science Advice Report) documents.

This could be a part of csasdown or its own thing. If it's own thing, really could use a better name.

See `experiments.R` for now.

Trying to go fully .docx to alleviate minor formatting pain, translation issues, and accessibility issues.

Note that when creating text to replace in a .docx file it's critical that you copy and paste the text (rather than typing it letter by letter) or the text will get broken up internally and the search won't find the tag.
